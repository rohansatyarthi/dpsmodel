# Diabetes Prediction System

This is a simple Streamlit web application for predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on patient data.

## Description

The Diabetes Prediction System uses machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes. It provides an average percentage of the likelihood of being diabetic based on the predictions of multiple machine learning models.
